# TypeScript Merge Function Project

## Introduction
This TypeScript project includes a `merge` function that combines two pre-sorted arrays of integers into a single sorted array. The implementation ensures that the merge is done manually without the use of any built-in sort functions.

## Requirements
- Node.js (version 12.0.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (typically comes with Node.js)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/haiibarose/ts-merge-function-project.git 

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ts-merge-function-project

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install

## Running Tests

1. ```sh
   npm test
